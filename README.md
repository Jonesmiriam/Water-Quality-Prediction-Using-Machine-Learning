Water Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning . This project aims to predict water quality based on various parameters using Machine Learning. It helps in determining whether water is safe for consumption by analyzing factors like pH, Turbidity, Hardness, and other chemical properties.  
Water Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning 💧
This project aims to predict water quality based on various parameters using Machine Learning. It helps in determining whether water is safe for consumption by analyzing factors like pH, Turbidity, Hardness, and other chemical properties.

🔍 Features
Predicts water quality as Safe or Unsafe
Uses multiple ML models:
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest Classifier (RFC)
Decision Tree (DT)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Compares model performance based on Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
User-friendly web interface built with Flask
Interactive result display with charts
📊 Dataset & Parameters
The model is trained on a dataset containing 10 parameters:

pH
Hardness
Solids
Chloramines
Sulfate
Conductivity
Organic Carbon
Trihalomethanes
Turbidity
Potability (Target variable: 0 = Unsafe, 1 = Safe)
🚀 Technologies Used
Machine Learning (SVM, RFC, DT, KNN)
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
Flask (for Web Interface)
HTML, CSS (for UI)
📌 How It Works?
Data Preprocessing – Cleaning, handling missing values, and feature scaling.
Model Training – Training multiple models and evaluating performance.
Prediction System – User inputs water parameters, and the system predicts safety.
Performance Comparison – Displays accuracy and metrics of each model.
🎯 Future Enhancements
Add more parameters for improved accuracy.
Integrate a real-time water quality testing API.
Deploy on a cloud platform for public access.
